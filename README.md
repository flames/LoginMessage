Plugin for bukkit (minecraft server mod) this is a simplified version of Tahkeh's LoginMessage.

loading configuration the bukkit way, stripped out ip/country recognition.

i made this, because i dont need most of the features Taheh's plugin has, but its sitll my favorite plugin.
i wont add fancy features. i want to keep this really simple and lightweight.

added the sample configuration.yml (its in german, change to fit your needs) if you dont use the configuration.yml, the plugin will use its
own default config that is in the jar
